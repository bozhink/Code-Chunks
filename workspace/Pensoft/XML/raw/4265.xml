                <p>In spite of various cytogenetic works on suborder Heteroptera, the chromosome organization, function and its evolution in this group is far from being fully understood. Cytologically, the family Rhyparochromidae constitutes a heterogeneous group differing in chromosome number. This family possessed XY sex mechanism in majority of the species with few exceptions. In the present work, multiple banding techniques viz., C- banding, base-specific fluorochromes (DAPI/CMA<sub>3</sub>) and silver nitrate staining have been used to characterize cytologically the chromosomes of seed plant pest <italic>Elasmolomus </italic>(<italic>Aphanus</italic>) <italic>sordidus </italic>Fabricius, 1787 having 2n=12=8A+2m+XY. One pair of the autosomes was large while three others were of almost equal size. At diplotene, C-banding technique revealed, that three autosomal bivalents show terminal constitutive heterochromatic bands while one medium sized bivalent was euchromatic. Microchromosomes (m-chromosomes) were positively heteropycnotic. After DAPI and CMA<sub>3</sub> staining, all the autosomal bivalents showed equal fluorescence, except CMA<sub>3</sub> positive signals, observed at both telomeric heterochromatic regions of one medium sized autosomal bivalent. Silver nitrate staining further revealed that this chromosome pair carries Nucleolar Organizer Regions (NORs) at the location of CMA<sub>3</sub> positive signals. The X chromosome showed a thick C-band, positive to both DAPI /CMA<sub>3</sub> while Y, otherwise C- negative, was weakly positive to DAPI and negative to CMA<sub>3</sub>, m-chromosomes were DAPI bright and CMA<sub>3</sub> dull.

            </title>
            <p>Heteroptera is a large cosmopolitan suborder comprising about 42,300 known species (Henry 2009). The species of Heteroptera are distributed into 7 infraorders and a total of 24 superfamilies worldwide (Schuh and Slater 1995). Lygaeidae, Rhyparochromidae Pyrrhocoridae, Coreidae, Pentatomidae, Reduviidae and Miridae are some of the major families, each having its individual economic importance (Schaefer and Panizzi 2000). Rhyparochromidae (seed bugs) were considered by most workers to be a subfamily within the Lygaeidae until revision by Henry (1997) who recognized them at the family level. Rhyparochromids are mostly ground dwellers, live in the shadow vegetation and feed primarily on seeds. <italic>Elasmolomus </italic>(<italic>Aphanus</italic>) <italic>sordidus </italic>is a serious pest, occurring on pods left drying in the fields and in stores. Groundnuts and sesame pods infested by this insect have shrivelled kernels. Like other heteropterans, Rhyparochromidae are characterized by holokinetic chromosomes and post reductional division of sex chromosomes, besides, presence of m-chromosomes and XY sex mechanism in all the species with few exceptions (Ueshima 1979).
            </p>
            <p>In the present contribution, cytological characterization of <italic>E</italic>. (<italic>Aphanus</italic>) <italic>sordidus</italic>,reported as <italic>Aphanus sordidus</italic> having chromosomal complement 2n=12=8A+2m+XY (Parshad 1957), has been done using different banding techniques. The amount and location (C-banding) and composition (AT/GC base richness) of heterochromatin have been studied. Further silver banding was employed to locate the position and number of nucleolar organiser regions (NORs). The application of CMA<sub>3</sub>/DAPI banding revealed correspondence between NORs (r-DNA sites) and GC rich domains.

</bold>
            </title>
            <p>Adult males of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>sordidus </italic>(9 specimens) were collected from field of sesame and groundnut plants in Punjab (India). Insects were dissected to take out the gonads and air dried slides were prepared. Aged air dried slides, were used for C-banding after Kaur et al. (2010). To study the localization of NORs, silver staining was done using one step method with a protective colloidal developer (gelatine and formic acid) (Howell and Black 1980). To reveal the base composition of C-heterochromatin, two fluorochromes: AT sequence specific DAPI (4-6’ Diamidino-2-phenylindole) and GC sequence specific CMA<sub>3</sub> (chromomycin A<sub>3</sub>), were applied, following the protocol suggested by Manicardi and Gautam (1994). Well spread stages were photographed under the microscope Nikon-Optiphot-2. Slides stained with fluorochrome dyes DAPI/CMA<sub>3</sub> were studied and photographed under Nikon fluorescent microscope using UV filter (for DAPI) and BV (for CMA<sub>3</sub>).

            <p>The chromosomal complement consists of twelve elements. Of these, eight are autosomes, two are m-chromosomes, while two of different sizes large and small, are sex chromosomes, X and Y, respectively. The chromosomal complement was confirmed as 2n=12=8A+2m+XY.

                <p>All the four autosomal bivalents show equal fluorescence with both DAPI and CMA<sub>3</sub> (Figs 3, 4). However, one of the medium sized autosomal bivalents shows bright CMA<sub>3</sub> signals at both ends, which correspond to NORs (Fig. 4). The X is positive to both DAPI /CMA<sub>3</sub> while Y is weak to DAPI and negative to CMA<sub>3</sub>, m-chromosomes are DAPI bright and CMA<sub>3</sub> dull (Figs 5, 6).

            </title>
            <p><italic>E</italic>. <italic>sordidus </italic>is a pest of pod crops mainly groundnut and sesame in India. Parshad (1957), was first to study its standard chromosomal complement (2n=12=8A+2m+XY) and male meiosis of this species (as <italic>Aphanus sordidus</italic>). Same chromosomal complement has been observed by the present authors. In the present study, C-banding, silver staining and DNA sequence-specific staining have been used to reveal the distribution and constitution of constitutive heterochromatin and, also to find the correspondence between NORs and GC rich regions.

                </title>
                <p>Terminal C-bands has been observed in three autosomal pairs of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>sordidus</italic>. In Heteroptera, the terminal C-bands are of wide occurrence. This kind of C-band location has been earlier reported in <italic>Antiteuchus mixtus </italic>(Fabricius, 1787) (Pentatomidae) by Lanzone and Souza (2006), in <italic>Dieuches</italic> <italic>uniguttatus </italic>(Thumb, 1822) and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>insignis </italic>(Distant, 1918) (Rhyparochromidae) by Kaur et al. (2010). Usually, telomeric bands are absent, if interstitial blocks are present in a chromosome. This is reported in one or two chromosomes of <italic>Nezara viridula </italic>Linnaeus, 1758 (Pentatomidae) and <italic>Triatoma patagonica </italic>Del-Ponte, 1929 (Reduviidae) by Camacho et al. (1985) and Panzera et al. (1997) respectively.
                </p>
                <p>One of the autosomal bivalent in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>sordidus</italic> was found to be euchromatic. A similar condition is observed in <italic>Nezara icterica </italic>(Horvath, 1889) (Pentatomidae) by Dey and Wangdi (1990), in <italic>Dieuches coloratus </italic>Distant, 1909 (Rhyparochromidae) by Kaur et al. (2010) and in <italic>Neophysopelta schlanbuschi </italic>Ahmad and Abbas, 1987 (Largidae) by Suman et al. (2012).
                </p>
                <p>The X chromosome is almost (2/3) completely C-positive and this condition has been earlier reported in Pentatomidae by Camacho et al. (1985), in Tingidae by Grozeva and Nokkala (2001) and in Nabidae by Grozeva et al. (2004). Whereas, the Y chromosome, is C- negative. This condition is not uncommon in Heteroptera and has been reported previously in some species belonging to Coreidae, Pentatomidae and Tingidae (Muramoto 1980, Camacho et al. 1985, Dey and Wangdi 1990, Grozeva and Nokkala 2001).
</p>
                <p>Microchromosomes are originally described by Wilson (1905) since then they have been discovered in many heteropteran families, including Rhyparochromidae. Microchromosomes are C-positive in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>sordidus</italic>. Similar observation has been made in <italic>Leptoglossus impictus </italic>(Stål, 1860) and <italic>Phthia picta </italic>(Drury, 1773) (Coreidae) by Bressa et al. (2005) and in <italic>Dieuches uniguttatus </italic>and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>insignis</italic> (Rhyparochromidae)by Kaur et al. (2010). Microchromosomes are DAPI bright and CMA<sub>3</sub> dull. Similar set of observations have been previously made by Kaur et al. (2010) in <italic>Dieuches uniguttatus </italic>and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>insignis </italic>(Rhyparochromidae). Still information on chromatin composition of m-chromosomes is very poor and their genetic constitution is not known fully.

                <title><bold-italic>DAPI/CMA<sub>3</sub> staining</bold-italic>
                </title>
                <p>The use of DNA binding fluorochromes having different base specificities allows a better characterization of heterochromatic regions in terms of their relative enrichment with AT or GC base pairs. In Heteroptera, still there is little information on heterochromatin base composition. The bright fluorescence after DAPI and CMA<sub>3</sub> staining observed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>sordidus </italic>indicates that the constitutive heterochromatic regions possess interspersed AT and GC repeats. Similar observations have been made in <italic>Edessa meditabunda </italic>(Fabricius, 1974) and <italic>E. rufomarginata </italic>(De Geer, 1773) (Pentatomidae) by <!--PageBreak-->Rebagliati et al. (2003), in <italic>Antiteuchus mixtus</italic>, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>macraspis </italic>(Perty, 1834), <italic>A</italic>. <italic>sepulcralis </italic>(Fabricius, 1803) (Pentatomidae) by Lanzone and Souza (2006) and in <italic>Arachnocoris trinitatus </italic>Bergroth, 1916 (Nabidae) by Kuznetsova et al. (2007).
                </p>
                <p>After silver banding and fluorochrome staining, the localization of CMA<sub>3</sub> positive bands in NOR regions on medium sized autosomal bivalent was revealed. It was confirmed that ribosomal genes are GC rich. This correspondence of CMA<sub>3 </sub>signals with NORs have also been reported for several true bug species at interstitial or terminal positions either on autosomes or sex chromosomes by Gonzalez-Garcia et al. (1996), Papeschi et al. (2003), Rebagliati et al. (2003), Grozeva et al. (2004). However, NORs do not always show GC base richness as is reported in <italic>Carlisis wahlbergi </italic>Stål, 1858 (Coreidae) by Fossey and Liebenberg (1995).
                </p>
                <p>A common feature of the sex chromosomes of Heteroptera is that they demonstrate bright fluorescence after both DAPI and CMA<sub>3</sub> during meiotic prophase (Rebagliati et al. 2003). In the present study, also the X chromosome showed fluorescence after both DAPI and CMA<sub>3</sub>. Similar observations have been made in <italic>Cimex emarginatus </italic>Simov, Ivanova and Schunger, 2006 by Grozeva and Nokkala (2002), <italic>Cimex lectularius</italic> (Cimicidae) by Grozeva et al. (2010), in <italic>Edessa meditabunda </italic>and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>rufomarginata </italic>(Pentatomidae) by Rebagliati et al.(2003), in <italic>Athaumastus haematicus </italic>(Stål, 1860), <italic>Leptoglossus impictus</italic> and <italic>Phthia picta </italic>(Coreidae), <italic>Jadera sanguinolenta </italic>(Fabricius, 1775) (Rhopalidae) by Bressa et al. (2005), in <italic>Antiteuchus mixtus</italic>, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>macraspis </italic>and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>sepulcralis </italic>(Pentatomidae) by Lanzone and Souza (2006). In the present study, however, the Y chromosome is C-negative, but DAPI positive and CMA<sub>3 </sub>negative. Similar observations have been made in <italic>Triatoma vitticeps </italic>(Stål, 1859) (Reduviidae) by Severi-Aguiar et al. (2006).

                <p>The silver impregnation stains not only the NORs but also the nucleolus at specific points of some chromosomes (Castanhole et al. 2008). In the present study, NORs were found to present on terminal regions on one of medium sized autosomal pairs of <italic>E. sordidus</italic>, like in <italic>Nysius californicus </italic>Stål, 1859 (Lygaeidae) (Souza et al. 2007), and in <italic>Arachnocoris trinitatus </italic>Bergroth, 1916 (Nabidae) (Kuznetsova et al. 2007). However, in Belostomatidae, NORs have been reported on either autosomes, on sex chromosomes or on both autosomes and sex chromosomes (Papeschi and Bidau 1985).

            </title>
            <p>Till date, very few Rhyparochromid species have been analysed cytologically based on banding techniques. The present study was able to reveal some cytogenetic characters which were used as markers for better knowledge of chromosome organization and the identification of separate chromosomes in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>sordidus</italic>. Much more information about true <!--PageBreak-->bug chromosomes could be obtained if new molecular cytogenetic techniques involving FISH (fluroscence <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization) mapping of chromosomes are used (Grozeva et al. 2011 and references therein; Kuznetsova et al. 2012 and references therein).
