</bold>
            </title>
            <p>The genus <italic>Dinotrema</italic> Foerster, 1862 is the largest braconid genus of the subfamily Alysiinae with approximately 320 species worldwide (Yu et al. 2012). The current position of the genus <italic>Dinotrema</italic> was suggested by van Achterberg (1988), and it differs from the related genus <italic>Aspilota</italic> Foerster, 1862 by the small size of the paraclypeal fovea which are distinctly separated from the inner margin of eyes. Species of <italic>Dinotrema</italic> parasitise in the larvae of Diptera predominantly belonging to the family Phoridae (van Achterberg 1988). Some species were also reared from the members of the families Anthomyiidae and Platypezidae (Fischer et al. 2008), but these data need to be verified.
            </p>
            <p>Fischer (1972) and Tobias (2003, 2004a, 2004b, 2006) suggested division of the <italic>Dinotrema</italic> species into some morphological groups characterized by extend and type of sculpture of the propodeum and presence/absence of the mesoscutal pit. These features were also used in recent papers on the Western Palaearctic species of the <italic>Dinotrema</italic> species and in the study of its Spanish species.
            </p>
            <p>In this paper, eight new Spanish species of the genus <italic>Dinotrema</italic> with a largely sculptured propodeum or having a large areola on the propodeum are described and illustrated, viz. <italic>D. amparoae</italic> sp. n., <italic>D. benifassaense</italic> sp. n., <italic>D. lagunasense</italic> sp. n., <italic>D. pilarae</italic> sp. n., <italic>D. robertoi </italic>sp. n., <italic>D. teresae </italic>sp. n.<bold>, </bold><italic>D. tinencaense</italic> sp. n.<bold>,</bold> and <italic>D. torreviejaense</italic> sp. n.

            </title>
            <p>The specimens for this study were collected by Malaise traps in the Natural Parks of Carrascal de la Font Roja (Alicante Province, Spain), La Tinença de Benifassà (Castellon Province, Spain) and Las Lagunas de La Mata-Torrevieja (Alicante Province, Spain). The climatic and orographic characteristics of these parks were described by Peris-Felipo and Jiménez-Peydró (2012).

            <p>For the terminology of the morphological features and sculpture, measurements and wing venation nomenclature, see Fischer (1973). The following abbreviations are used in the paper: POL - post-ocellar line; OOL - ocular-ocellar line; OD - maximum diameter of lateral ocellus.

                    <p> This new species resembles <italic>D. lagunasense </italic>Peris-Felipo sp. n., <italic>D. adventum</italic> (Fischer) (comb. n.), <italic>D. sternaulicum </italic>(Fischer) and <italic>D. necrophilum</italic> (Hedqvist). New species <!--PageBreak-->differs from <italic>D. lagunasense </italic>in having the first metasomal tergite 2.3 times as long as its apical width and mainly smooth (1.8 times and finely striate in apical half in <italic>D. lagunasense</italic>), hind femur 3.6 times as long as its maximum width (3.9 times in <italic>D. lagunasense</italic>), and mesoscutal pit elongate-oval (rounded in <italic>D. lagunasense</italic>). On the other hand, <italic>D. torreviejaense </italic>sp. n. differs from <italic>D. adventum </italic>in having the mandible 0.9 times as long as wide (1.45 times in <italic>D. adventum</italic>), first flagellar segment 2.75 times as long as wide (twice in <italic>D. adventum</italic>), hind femur 3.6 times as long as its maximum width (4.0 times in <italic>D. adventum</italic>), and first metasomal tergite 2.3 times as long as its apical width (twice in <italic>D. adventum</italic>). Also, new species differs from <italic>D. sternaulicum</italic> in having the mandible 0.9 times as long as wide (1.4 times in <italic>D. sternaulicum</italic>), first flagellar segment 2.75 times as long as wide (3.0 times in <italic>D. sternaulicum</italic>), middle flagellar segments 1.8–1.9 times as long as their width (1.5 times in <italic>D. sternaulicum</italic>), and first metasomal tergite 2.3 times as long as its apical width (1.75 times in <italic>D. sternaulicum</italic>). Finally, <italic>D. torreviejaense </italic>sp. n. differs from <italic>D. necrophilum </italic>in having the mandible 0.9 times as long as wide (1.45 times in <italic>D. necrophilum</italic>), middle flagellar segments 1.8–1.9 times as long as their width (1.3 times in <italic>D. necrophilum</italic>), hind femur 3.6 times as long as its maximum width (4.1 times in <italic>D. necrophilum</italic>), and first metasomal tergite 2.3 times as long as its apical width (1.6 times in <italic>D. necrophilum</italic>).

Eye in lateral view 1.75 times as high as wide and 0.75 times as wide as temple. POL 3.15 times OD; OOL 3.15 times OD. Face 1.4 times as wide as high; inner margins of eyes subparallel. Clypeus 3.0 times as wide as high, slightly curved ventrally. Paraclypeal fovea elongate, reaching middle distance between clypeus and eye. Mandible strongly widened, 0.9 times as long as its maximum width. Upper tooth of mandible long, but weakly shorter than middle tooth; middle tooth the longest, wide basally and narrowed towards apex, weakly rounded apically; lower tooth short and wide, wider than upper tooth, rounded. Antennae thick, more than 13-segmented (apical segments missing). Scape twice as long as pedicel. First flagellar segment 2.75 times as long as its apical width, 1.1 times as long as second segment; second segment twice as long as its maximum width.
