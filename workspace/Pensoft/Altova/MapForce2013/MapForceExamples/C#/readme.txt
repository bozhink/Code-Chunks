This sample demonstrates calling a C# function from a MapForce mapping.

To use it, you need:

  * an installed .NET framework
  * to add Format.dll as a function library by double-clicking it in the Project window.

The source code for the C# function is provided in the file Format\Format.cs.
Solution and project files for Visual Studio 2005 are also included for easy recompilation.

To add your own .NET assemblies as MapForce libraries, click "Add/Remove Libraries" in the Libraries window,
then click "Add" and select your compiled .dll file.

For further information, please refer to the MapForce documentation.
