This sample demonstrates calling a Java function from a MapForce mapping.

To use it, you need:

  * an installed Java SE 6 Runtime Environment
  * to add Format.class as a function library by double-clicking it in the Project window.

The source code for the Java function is provided in the file Format\Format.java.

To add your own Java classes as MapForce libraries, click "Add/Remove Libraries" in the Libraries window,
then click "Add" and select your compiled .class file.

For further information, please refer to the MapForce documentation.
