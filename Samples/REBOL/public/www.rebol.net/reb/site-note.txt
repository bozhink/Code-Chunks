NOTE ON SITES:

Please be sure that your site contains something useful
to REBOL users. That can be REBOL demos, applications,
documentation, news, links, or whatever.

Sites with nothing about REBOL will be removed to reduce
the "noise level" in this index.

Also, please provide an email link on your site for
user comments.  It's as easy as adding:

   file "Contact" you@example.com

in your index.r file.  Or, you can create your own feedback
method by adapting the feedback.r script to your own use.
