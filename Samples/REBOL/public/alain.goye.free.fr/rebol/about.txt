Welcome !

Here are some scripts I wrote while learning REBOL, 
some are useful to me, please tell me if they also are useful to you !

The most recent is Notereb:
an exercise to demonstrate a nice tree interface, in the style of TreePad(TM) (http://www.treepad.com/)

mailcheck.r:
Periodically checks for new messages in different mailboxes. 
Displays senders and subjects on request.
I use Outlook Express for reading and sending mail with different identities (personal / professional...).
The first use of this script is to tell me if other mailboxes are full and if I must switch account to read them.
I added a function to display basic info. on each message and delete spam before it gets to my mailbox. 
(to this regard I wish REBOL would allow reading only the 1st lines of a message, as the POP protocol does if I'm right)
I added the "Deluxe Email Spam Killer" from REBOL library but it still needs a better spam filter... 

smailcheck.r:
is an earlier version of mailcheck.r... "for beginners".

microbase.r:
is an exercise on a basic tree-structured database
The database is made of nested blocks like [ key1 value1 key2 value2 key3 value3... ] where:
- key is a *** string *** (so that find/any works ; better ideas welcome)
- value is any type, including a new block like [ key11 value11 key12 value12 key13 value13... ]
The key function of this file is the select-value function, which can search the database with many options,
including wildcards, replacement, variable recursion depth...
The GUI allows to browse the tree basically with right / left key buttons 
(sorry I don't know how it goes for 1-button mouse systems and users)
Note that walk-forest from %tree-functions.r can interestingly be applied on such a base...

menuex.r:
demonstrates an easy way to simulate scrolldown menus with REBOL/view
