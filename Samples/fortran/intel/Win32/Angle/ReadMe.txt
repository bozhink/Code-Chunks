ANGLE - Draw an angle on a grid

This application demonstrates the use of the Win32 APIs for dialog input
and graphic drawing. A grid is displayed and a dialog above it requests
the following information:

X and Y - coordinates of the center of the partial circle to be drawn
nRadius - radius of the partial circle
eStartAngle - starting angle in degrees for the partial circle sweep
eSweepAngle - number of degrees through which the partial circle should sweep

The Draw button is then clicked to draw the partial circle, which includes a line
drawn from the center to the circle start.
