'Thanks for trying Just BASIC v1.01, our completely free BASIC
'language based on our popular Liberty BASIC language!
'
'Use Just BASIC to write useful software, create software for
'sale, to create games, and to teach and learn programming.
'
'What to do first? Here are some ideas:
' - Look at some of the example programs (Click File+Open)
' - Check out the tutorial (under the Help menu)
' - Browse the internet resources (under the Help menu)
' - Play a game (mayhem.bas, hanoi.bas, ttt.bas)
' - Play with the Freeform GUI editor (under the Run menu)
'
'Here are some of Just BASIC's exciting features:
' - A real BASIC for Windows!
' - Great price!  Completely FREE!
' - Write modular code with subprograms and functions
' - Simple and easy to use GUI capabilities
' - Freeform GUI builder for drawing GUIs (look under the Run menu)!
' - Create games with sprite animation, sound, and music!
' - Great internet community helps learn & provide support!
' - Support for serial communications!
' - Runtime engine supports creation of standalone programs!
'
'Helpful pointers:
'
'1) Please study the help file carefully.  There is a
'lot of useful information in it.
'
'2) Try the example programs that come with Just BASIC
'for examples of how to do lots of different things.
'Just click on the File menu and choose Open for a
'really big list of examples.
'
'3) Look at the tutorial, which is under the Help menu.
'
'4) Don't forget to investigate the World of Just BASIC
'popup that appears when you start Just BASIC.
'
'5) If you want to create a standalone program, then
'you need to use the runtime engine.  Look at the help
'file section Using the Runtime Engine for detailed
'instructions.
'
'6) If you want to build a GUI, try the FreeForm tool
'which is located under the Run menu in the editor.
'A lot of people modify FreeForm to meet their own
'needs.  You can do this too.  Just open the file
'fformj10.bas to see the code for the FreeForm editor.
'
'7) You can't open more than one program at a time in
'the Just BASIC editor, but you can edit more than one
'Just BASIC program at a time by starting as many Just
'BASIC editors as you need.
'
'8) If you need more power, give Liberty BASIC a try.
'It runs all Just BASIC programs, plus it adds a lot of
'powerful commands to the language and helpful features
'to the editor and debugger.
